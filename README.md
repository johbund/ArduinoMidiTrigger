# ArduinoMidiTrigger
*by Johannes Bund*

Code and schematic of a selfmade drum trigger pad. The pad is used to control an Arturia DrumBrute.
The project consists of two arduino sketches.
 
 - **ArduinoTriggerTest**: A sketch that can be used to test a single trigger pad. Includes various outputs to a serial monitor.
 - **ArduinoMidiTrigger**: The main sketch. Scan the sensors and send Midi events accordingly.
